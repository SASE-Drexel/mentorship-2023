about: I think I am someone who always goes for what I want. I'm an ISTP, but I can be a tiny bit extroverted when pushed. I like people who are sweet but also like crazy, sick in the head funny. I procrastinate all the time, but I still get good grades on my exams (except for physics) Otherwise, I'm totally an academic weapon.
year: Sophomore

### About

I think I am someone who always goes for what I want. I'm an ISTP, but I can be a tiny bit extroverted when pushed. I like people who are sweet but also like crazy, sick in the head funny. I procrastinate all the time, but I still get good grades on my exams (except for physics) Otherwise, I'm totally an academic weapon.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

My mentor and her mentor won best mentorship two years ago, and my mentor and I won best mentorship last year, so I must keep the mentorship streak LOL

Besides that, I had and currently have a close relationship to my own mentor, and because she has really helped me adjust to college and be a friend for me overall, I wanted to convey that feeling to another person.

### Career Goals

My career goal is to either work in forensic chemistry or take my degree in a more environmental chemistry/environmental criminal justice type of direction!

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I like to play card games, listen to music (occasionally dance teehee), I like to rearrange my room at terrible hours of the day and go to sleep at equally terrible hours.

### What to Expect From Me

I would mentor my mentee by always being there for them like waking up early for their event, being their friend, offering advice when I can. We would be very active in SASE, showing up to and winning as many mentorship events as possible to win best mentorship!!!!!

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I would envision our relationship as a friendly and close relationship, one where they can lean on me, ask anything they want, and be assured that they can trust me. I also envision us being present and together at a ton of events and having a lot of fun!
