### About

I'm not sure how to describe myself, so I will describe myself from the perspective of a police officer describing me as a suspect:

Male, 19, approximately 5'8", likely half Cantonese/Vietnamese, probably has a chinchilla named pancake as a pet, awful handwriting, a bit reserved as a person but enjoys quality time with friends

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be a SASE mentor because having a SASE mentor when I was a freshman was such a welcoming way to start Drexel. I want to be a SASE mentor to make sure my mentee gets a good experience the way I got from my mentor last year. One of my regrets from last year was not spending enough time with my mentor, and I set aside plenty of time this year to spend with my mentee, to make it up for last year. 

### Career Goals

My career goal is to work in robotics, I'm currently trying to BS/MS into EE/Robotics, and then try to land me a co-op at a robotics company (hopefully NASA) so I can learn how to work with robots :)

### Co-ops

Lockheed Martin (and kung fu tea)

### Interests

I really enjoy going to arcades (specifically round one), playing ping pong or tennis, going to EDM festivals, and playing games like csgo and osu

### What to Expect From Me

I would mentor my mentee through experiences. These experiences would be bringing them to organizations/clubs/places I enjoy or teach them skills that have benefitted me in life. I would also mentor them in academics, if they happened to major in STEM, though SASE mentorships isn't office hours! My mentee wouldn't need the same major as me. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Our relationship would fit my mentee, I will give them as much of my time as they desire or have time for. Though ultimately, I simply want to be seen as sort of an older brother figure to them. And by that, I mean as someone they can come to for advice as they need, or simply to hang/study with.
