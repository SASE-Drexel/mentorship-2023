### About

I find myself going to the DAC a lot to workout, go on a run, play squash, ping pong, or even shoot around at the basketball courts. I'm a big fan of Marvel movies, going to Costco, and the 76ers. I also enjoy photography and watching youtube videos while eating food.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I'd hope to work at a large financial institution doing marketing or consulting. I also see myself jumping around different careers and not just sticking to one thing. 

### Career Goals

Going into my senior year, I want to help as many people and being a SASE mentor has always been such a rewarding experience for me. I don't expect to be paired up or anything (especially since I already have mentees from previous years so I don't want to take the opportunity away from anyone), but I just want to be an option for people.

### Co-ops

KKR, Chubb, J.P. Morgan

### Interests

I'm always going to be super supportive of my mentees and be there for them whenever they need me. I usually like to let the mentees determine what sort of mentorship they're looking for, whether they are seeking professional advice or simply just a new friend on campus. I'm easily accessible via text and love to attend mentorship events or just hang out whenever. 

### What to Expect From Me

I'm an INFJ-T and an old head at Drexel lol. I've done a lot throughout my time here including 3 co-ops, 3 e-boards (GCC, SASE, PSP), and 3 majors. Safe to say, I'm an ambitious person haha, but I love to wind down and have fun!

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I see the relationship being pretty chill. I like catching up with my mentees and seeing them around campus and at events.
