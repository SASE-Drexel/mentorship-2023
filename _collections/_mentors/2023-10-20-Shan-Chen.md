### About

I'm a Philly native and I am an ENFP! I like to eat out a lot and I just love eating in general. My favorite animals are capybaras and otters! I am a pretty chill person and I am always down to meet new people!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

When I was a freshman, I had a really great mentor (shout out to Darian :D) and now that I am old and somewhat knowledgeable, I would like to be able to mentor others as well! I would also love to have a plug for urban chicken nuggets and brussel sprouts :)

### Career Goals

I want to retire by 40. I want to work at a fun company as either a software engineer or project manager.

### Co-ops

Est√©e Lauder Lab Quality Assurance Co-op

### Interests

In my free time, I like to play videogames. I normally play Valorant and TFT, but right now Bee Swarm Simulator on ROBLOX has a grip on me. I also like listening to music (RnB, Indie, and Bedroom Pop) and collecting Smiskis!

### What to Expect From Me

I would be a pretty chill mentor, just someone who is always there for my mentee whenever they may need me!

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Shrek and Donkey, besties 4 life
