### About

dragonboat, outrigger canoeing, thrifting, playing wordhunt, exploring the city & eat delicious food, listen to music (rnb & kpop)

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

To pass my FE exam before graduating from Drexel 

### Career Goals

Coming into college I hoped to look for an upperclassmen who was in major to help guide me throw my classes and share their experience within the discipline; however, I wasn't able to meet anyone. I want to be the change for the people in my major for the lowerclassmen so that they can have a different experience than me. As a CAEE major I hope to open doors to other CAEE lowerclassmen to feel like they have someone to talk to able their career goals/explorations. have i mentioned i love to network with ppl :)

### Co-ops

DC Beane and Associates Construction Company (Assistant Project Manger) & AECOM (Track Rail Designer)

### Interests

I hope my mentorship with my mentee will be like hanging out with a close friend. I want my mentee to be able to talk to me about anything their life and that our mentorship isn't strictly school related. And if they have any career interest they want to know more about i hope share my knowledge with them.

### What to Expect From Me

i'm an ambivert, big city type of girl. I like to take spontaneous trips exploring places i've never been to and trying new foods. i am very ambitious and i usually know what i want so if you need someone to tell you to make an impulse purchase i'm that person. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision my relationship with my mentee to be like talking to a friend. I want to be able to go out to eat with my mentee and just talk about life and our interests.
