### About

AI, Books, Controversies in Politics, Exploring New Cafes, and Music (I make the best playlists)

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

To build a career which is exciting and brings new challenges everyday and involves constant improvement and growth.

### Career Goals

Throughout my freshman year of college and through my experience with SASE I have learnt a lot of meaningful lessons which I would like to share with my mentee. Above all I am looking forward to a great bond and friendship.

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

Hey! I know college can be hard and stressful but debriefing in an aesthetic cafe with coffee in your hand works like magic. I am ready to be the go to helpline number for my mentee. However, I want to be considerate and respectful of my mentee's interests and choices thus, giving them full liberty to shape this bond in whatever way they want.

### What to Expect From Me

Just an average depressed engineering student trying to connect the dots and understand the pattern. Beyond that I am an ambitious and rational human who gives useful advice (only when asked for). I love having meaningful discussions and just hearing peopleâ€™s ideas and stories. If you have anything to share I am all ears to you. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

A great friendship where we cherish each other's interests and goals.
