### What to Expect From Me

i am an oldhead #seniorüëµüèΩ so i would give my mentee advice on how to navigate their time at drexel easily. if they're a first year i can help them get adjusted to the fast-paced quarter system by giving them tips + tricks on how i managed to slay my classes at drexel. im a psych major too so i would definitely be there for them if they need someone to talk to about any struggles they are experiencing, my degree is literally on how to be a good listener/empathizer :P
