### About

I like video-editing/photography (trying to start my youtube channel LOL), playing wordhunt (i have 1k+ wins), making spotify playlists, recording myself eat, watching kdramas and anime, collecting smiskis :))) I also listen to a good amount of EDM music - I am known to go to quite a bit of events :')

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want my work to benefit the community whether is aiding them or for sources of entertainment. I am interested in both front and backend engineering, so I would see myself doing full-stack work in the future.

### Career Goals

As someone with a lot of experience whether it's academically, personally, socially, I want to be someone that my mentee to turn to for advice throughout their college and adulting journey.

### Co-ops

Neuroflow (Site-Reliability Engineer | 2nd Co-op), eMoney Advisor (Python Developer | 1st Co-op)

### Interests

I would be a easy-going and laid-back mentor to my mentee. If they ever have anything they need help with or are worried about I will help them the best that I can or find as many resources possible for them. I would mentor them in the many different areas they need.

### What to Expect From Me

Hello Helloo :) I'm a pretty extroverted and open person and down-to-earth! I am also considered a grandma now so :D 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I see my relationship with my mentee pretty laid-back and chill. I want to be like a friend that my mentee can reach out to from time to time whether it's for help or just to hang out/talk and goof off. I also want to be someone they can turn to for insight or advice as new experiences come their way.
