### About

I feel like I don't have actual hobbies. I really like to relax when I'm not being an academic weapon, so mostly watch internet videos or play online games. Also, I am an extrovert, so I do like to socialize rather than hide in my shell at home.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to work with more sustainability, like waste management or renewable energy sources, which I haven't had the chance to work on, so after college, I want to explore down that path more. But in the end, I just want to be happy at my job ... and if all else fails, I'll marry rich.

### Career Goals

I have always wanted to get into the Mentor/Mentee program, but have always forgotten to sign up. However, as I enter my senior year, I definitely want to leave some of my wisdom to the kids, so here I am :D

### Co-ops

Philadelphia Water Department (Stormwater Biling Incentives Team) & Bohler Engineering

### Interests

I want to be your friend, maybe your bestie. As your SASE mentor, it would be great to help you openly with your personal and/or professional life. It really depends on how open you want to be.

### What to Expect From Me

hi! most people call me jenny. #BeeSwarmSimulator #MergeMansion #PokemonGo

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I don't know, it's my first time. I would prefer to be involved with your life, but it's up to you :p It'd be nice to hang out for some food and just talk or even we can study together or whatnot.
