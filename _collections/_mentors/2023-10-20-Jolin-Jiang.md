### About

Honkai, manga, webnovels, making spotify playlists, ranking things, editing my notion.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I do not dream of labor. But yeah a software engineering job that pays lots would be nice.

### Career Goals

As a mentee last year and an introvert I felt like my mentor was one people who really helped me broaden my social circle in a way I couldn't have, just having a backbone to reply on was really great as well. I'm being a mentor this year to help give back the help I got. 

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I hope to help them academically and personally but above all I hope to be someone they can always rely on and feel supported by. As the youngest in my family I really wanted a younger sibling so I hope to build a bond that strong. 

### What to Expect From Me

I'm from NYC! I'm kind of quiet at first and meeting new people stresses me out sometimes but I try my best. I may look mad but I swear I'm not... I'm always open to talk to someone over text even if we've never met. I like giving myself a little treat everyday and have recently developed a caffeine addiction.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)
