### About

I like video games (multiplayer and single-player) like CS2 and I listen to music a lot (would like to learn guitar at some point). Im also interested in chasing the bag and getting rich.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Currently would like to secure a job with a large financial or software company. Then move upwards to build capital to create a business venture with.

### Career Goals

I would like to be a SASE mentor in order to become more involved in the community as well as potentially help someone out. I've also been wanting to get out of my comfort zone and think this would be a great opportunity.

### Co-ops

Nuix, SIG, SAP

### Interests

I think I'd like to act as a resource that is available for the mentee. I'd like to be their friend, so helping them with professional and personal goals/issues would be something I'd be interested in doing too. 

### What to Expect From Me

I am a gamer and sometimes athlete (I wanna get out more). I am not usually serious but I think I can do it if needed. I want to meet more people and get out of my comfort zone.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Strictly professional. We can be professional friends. As in I will professionally be their guy!
