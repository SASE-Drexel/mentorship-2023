### About

I tend to enjoy filling my schedule, whether it be with hobbies, clubs, or work. I like things to be organized, typically finishing my work first so I can enjoy my time without having to worry about other things. I value creativity and authenticity above most other things, and try to keep them present throughout my day. Although I enjoy working alone, I love having the company of others in both projects and daily life.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I find it exciting to showcase what I've learned in my life and help others skip the more difficult parts that I may have gone through. I can help my mentee organize their work and look at their schedule as something digestible rather than overwhelming. Not only that but I can help teach them ways to help others and stay consistent with their lifestyle, and because it's one individual, I can make it specialized and hopefully create a great bond.

### Career Goals

I would like to work in the hotel industry and preferably on the management level of things. I enjoy working with people and I would like to reach a point where I can work along the numerous departments of the hotel to enhance experiences of both guests and employees.

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I really enjoy creative arts. Things such as drawing, writing, and reading are my favorite hobbies. I'm continuously intrigued by fictional works in both novels, comics, and video games. It's really interesting looking into someone else's creative mind, and by doing so I find that I can expand my own.

### What to Expect From Me

I would start my mentorship by getting to know my mentee. I would like to organize hangouts in some of my favorite spots on campus to allow them to get to know me as well. I would also try to help them with their schedule and organization, maybe by planning weekly check-ins at a cafe or study hangouts. If they need assistance with understanding things in the city, or recommendations, or general advice, I'd also like to help with that.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Since I only have older siblings, I'd love to see my mentee as the younger sibling I never had, or just as a close friend.
