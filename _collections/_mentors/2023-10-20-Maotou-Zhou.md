### About

I'm someone who thinks big picture and likes to spread my philosophical wisdom to my close friends. That's not to say I can't goof around and have fun, but it's just rather my priorities will be more focused on growth/growing as a person.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to leave a legacy, and hopefully spread my wisdom so that I can provide value to my community, instead of being closed off and avoiding deeper connections rather than surface level ones. 

### Career Goals

Startup, Finance Firm, or Influencer. (Or all above). More realistically: Marketing Manager or Consultant

### Co-ops

Paralegal

### Interests

Extroverted Hobbies: Networking, Gyming, Tennis, Swimming, Ping-Pong, Boxing, Volleyball.

Introverted: Studying, Sleeping, Eating, Reading, Asian TV Dramas, Anime/Manga/Manhwa, Art/Photography.

### What to Expect From Me

I would approach it in terms of a teacher/life coach perspective. Where we are able to work together, and create a list of priorities/goals to work towards. Of course it doesn't need to be fully thought out, but it's aimed to give some direction of what my mentee wants for their college experience.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Similar to as mentioned before, I would be guiding/looking after them in terms of academics, sports, healthy balanced lifestyle, and creating something meaningful that they can use with them; way after they graduate and enter the real world.
