### About

I'm a second year computer engineering student which is perfect since I like robots and space. Eventually, I want to automate my life with AI and robots like homework and chores. And it'd be cool if I could make a lot of money off of it.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to mentor to give back to all of the people who have taught me over the years. I feel like I'm at the point in my life where I can start to help out the next generation. And also, more friends wouldn't hurt.

### Career Goals

To make fat stacks, and also Robotics and Aerospace

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

Space, Robots, Anime, Games, Hiking, Fishing, Ocean stuff, STEM in general

### What to Expect From Me

My mentorship would be first and foremost a friend. I would want them to be comfortable and not intimidated in any way. I'd also try my best to help them grow as a person because I think that's better than just give them answers. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision my relationship with my mentee as a friend who believes they can rely on me on in any aspect in life.
