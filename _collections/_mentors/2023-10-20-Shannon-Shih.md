### About

I like cooking, although college cooking is a nuisance. I also love watching dramas and just listening to music. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I am a BS/MD student on the four-year track so I hope to matriculate and attend DUCOM! As of now I hope to become a pediatrician. If I fail that, well, I guess hopefully I can be a biomedical engineer. 

### Career Goals

I want to be a SASE mentor because I had the best time in SASE last year as a freshman and I've met some of my closest friends through the organization. I want to meet new freshmen and hopefully provide them with some guidance the way many SASE people did for me last year. 

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I'm pretty chill so my mentorship would probably be more like that of a friend. 

### What to Expect From Me

Hihi! I'm a sophomore at Drexel (clearly) and I grew up in suburban Philly. I'm pretty outgoing and a huge foodie. In my free time I'm usually hanging out with friends or watching shows. I love meeting new people and being social!

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I want to be a friend, but obviously also a place of guidance. If you ever have any questions whether that be about life, school, or career always feel free to come to me!
