### About

Hihi, I'm Terie! I like to think I'm a pretty outgoing person and I always love meeting new people! I'm always hanging around at events, so if you're ever looking for someone to share dad jokes and bad puns with, a carpool karaoke buddy, or just a listening ear, I gotchu ;)

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I remember feeling so uncertain and lost during my freshman year, and my mentor was someone who helped me out a lot and guided me through. Being a SASE mentee was one of my favorite experiences so far in college, and I want to be able to provide that for my mentee! I want to be a friend to my mentee, someone they can count on to support, advise, and just spend time with them!

### Career Goals

I'm still figuring out exactly what I want to do in the field of tech, but I ultimately just want a career where I can constantly learn and grow and try new things without feeling like I'm stuck in one place.

### Co-ops

Asset Health Analyst at PECO, Solutions Architect Analyst at LSAC

### Interests

I love spending time with people and going on spontaneous adventures! I'm definitely a huge foodie so I'm always down to explore and go out on food/boba dates :)) I also spend way too much time on TikTok and am currently rewatching Friends for the third time, so I'll always accept show recs!

### What to Expect From Me

Definitely more of a friendship/older sibling vibe, the most important part of being a mentor is just being there for my mentee whenever they need me! I want to make sure that they know I'm always there for them by checking in on them, giving them advice, and going on plenty of mentor-mentee bonding dates :)

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Very lighthearted and fun for sure! I want my mentee to feel comfortable coming to me as a friend for anything, whether it be personal or professional. We can talk about classes and co-ops, rant about life, send each other TikToks, or just hang out and grab food :D
