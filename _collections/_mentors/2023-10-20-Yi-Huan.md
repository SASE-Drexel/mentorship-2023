### About

I'm a commuter! Born and raised Philly native. I'm sick of our Chinatown, but if you need any pointers on where to eat, let me know! On the top of my head, there's Hiro Ramen, Nanzhou Handdrawn Noodles, and 4 Rivers. In terms of horoscopes, I'm an aries; zodiac monkey; mbti isfp. cold >>> hot! I really like the cold air, but it makes it sooo hard to wake up in the morning. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Well I've been a mentee quite a couple of times through various programs, and it has always been a beneficial experience. I received so much guidance professionally and socially that I want to offer my experiences, knowledge, and skills to anyone interested. 

### Career Goals

I'm not too sure at the moment. I want to explore UXID more and maybe other related career fields before settling or deciding on what my career goals are. 

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

In terms of my interests, I enjoy many forms of art, especially photography and graphic design. I would say eating is a hobby. I enjoy cooking...when it's just for myself. I would definitely say most of my actual hobbies involve being stationary but I have been wanting to get more active. I try to join sase sometimes when they head to the Cliffs to climb during their monthly BIPOC nights. 

### What to Expect From Me

I'm excited to make new friends and provide guidance when and where they ask for it.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Casual and friendly
