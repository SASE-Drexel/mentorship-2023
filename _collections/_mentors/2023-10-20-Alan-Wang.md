### About

Hi my name is Alan and I like to sleep.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

There were so many things I learned from my mentor last year and we made many good memories. I want to be able to share that experience with my mentee.

### Career Goals

I am currently exploring my options but I really want do something pertaining to machine learning in the future.

### Co-ops

currently lacking employment

### Interests

I like to spend my free time being active whether that would be going to the gym,  bouldering (if its free). I also like playing valorant. (please carry me im gold )

### What to Expect From Me

Uhhhh to be honest I can't really guide them in a professional aspect because I haven't done my co op's yet, but I want to be able to be friends with my mentee and have more of a social relationship. Instead of professional advice I would probably give my mentee more practical and academic advice. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)
