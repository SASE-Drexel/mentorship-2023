### About

Usually keep to myself, if I am comfortable talking to you I tend to ramble about things. Basically, pretty introverted with an occasion to talk on about something. Fairly quiet besides that unless you are playing games with me. Love learning new things and always feel the need to be doing something new or practice something else.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

After not having a mentor, I realized it would have been nice to have someone to ask questions to whenever I wanted especially ones more related to my major. It would have made my life a lot easier so I want to be able to provide that for someone. Also there are not many ECE kids out there so I have to represent.

### Career Goals

Aim to work as an Electrical or Computer engineer at the Naval yard would be ideal for me. Anything else that happens is a bonus. 

### Co-ops

Drexel, Lockheed Martin, OPEX Corp.

### Interests

I am an active person (whenever my ankle is not broken). I am very much into sports, I like playing soccer and watching all philly sports. I play video games, mostly CS but any FPS will do for me. I also enjoy playing piano whenever I have free time (Disclaimer: I am not very good do not ask me to play anything).

### What to Expect From Me

My mentorship would really be showing up at all the events and just being relaxed while being easily approachable. I want to be mentoring someone that is also able to handle things on their own while I am just a guiding voice. However if push comes to shove, I can provide a voice of reason and try my best to provide solutions to whatever problem he/she encounters.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Someone easy to talk to and hang out with. I want to always be available if they have a question.
