### About

I love all sports and just being in the outdoors. Avid soccer and mma fan. I enjoy grappling martial arts like wrestling, bjj, and judo and am also currently training as an amateur boxer. Besides sports, I play some improv piano and guitar. Also interested in learning how to dance.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Thinking of opening a Korean food truck on Drexel or UPenn’s campus.

### Career Goals

I would like to be a SASE mentor so I can teach freshman to learn from some of the mistakes I’ve made and to not follow my example lol. I think being a mentor involves just as much learning as teaching and I look at the SASE mentorship program as an amazing opportunity to learn from others and to learn how to support others.

### Co-ops

2 prior co-ops: Public Areas Supervisor at the Denali Princess Lodge and Supply Chain Analyst for Inter-IKEA

### Interests

I honestly don’t know what it would look like because I’ve never mentored anyone before. I know I’ll be there for my mentee in terms of answering any questions they have about Drexel or about life in general, and to also listen to their concerns and anything they might be struggling with. I can see myself cheering them on and supporting them in whatever way I can. I’m open to adjusting my mentorship style to accommodate the needs of my mentee. 

### What to Expect From Me

Current Junior in the 5 year 3 coop program studying econ. Planning to switch my major to another area of business. Personality wise, I would say I’m more of an introvert in most situations, and I tend to think before I speak. People who know me well describe me as a troublemaker with ADHD. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision me and my mentee as being good friends who are open to learn from one another.
