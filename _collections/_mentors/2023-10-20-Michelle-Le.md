### About

I like cats, strawberries, and cute little trinkets such as pins and figurines. I'm usually spending time with my friends but I also like being creative (animation, motion graphics, video editing, painting, etc). I indulge in anime/manga as well and sometimes play games (I suck rlly bad). 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Designing apps/websites. I would love to combine UX/UI with animation or maybe go into front-end development. I just wanna make enough money and become a cat lady tbh.

### Career Goals

College made (and still makes) me fight for my life so I feel that being that support for someone who needs it will be beneficial. I also just like meeting people and making friends. 

### Co-ops

Motion Graphics Intern @ MJH Life Sciences

### Interests

I can be someone you can talk to about anything, no matter how random. It'll be fun just to hang out and share hobbies, and/or I can help with academics and co-op related things.

### What to Expect From Me

I'm a pretty chill person! Initially, I'm fairly introverted but I really like being around people and can warm up to others pretty fast.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision a nice friendship where we can do anything together! Whatever my mentee is comfortable with.
