### About

I would like to apologize in advance for my 10 year old boy humor but iâ€™ll make up for it in boba or lunch dates :D

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Iâ€™d like to be a SASE mentor because my mentor last year was really nice annd funny and is kind of like an older sister to me now. I think having a mentee would be a cool experience; like we could go on boba dates, get food together, and talk about random stuffs. And if they were to need any help or advice on anything, iâ€™m always a phone call or text away ðŸ’ª

### Career Goals

My main career goals are to make enough money so that i donâ€™t have to stress over financial problems, and enjoy my work

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I love listening to music, playing video games, and rock climbing with friends! I also really enjoy watching trashy shows. My favorite foods consist of anything with potatoes, tomatoes, and TOFUUUU. If YOU donâ€™t like TOFU, then i donâ€™t know how you live (jk)

### What to Expect From Me

I would mentor my potential mentee by being a helpful hand through their first year and hopefully throughout their drexel career too. Evidently, I canâ€™t and wonâ€™t be there for every single thing but i hope that if they need anything theyâ€™ll reach out, whether it be about academics, personal life, sase, or whatever else!
