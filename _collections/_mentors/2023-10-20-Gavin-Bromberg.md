### About

This is going to be long. Rocketry, astronomy, quantum chemistry, cooking, classical music, cycling, baking, human and computer language design, abstract mathematics, strategy and management simulation video games, chess, other puzzle games, and helping people learn more about themselves and the world around them.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I plan to go into the field of AI that is Natural Language Processing, which is the study of how languages and AI interact. I aspire additionally to go into project management and hope to start my own firm at some point, with a focus on the intersection between quantum computing and AI.

### Career Goals

I have actually already participated in the SASE Mentorship program already, and I've thoroughly enjoyed that experience. I very much prefer bidirectional communication, and I'm hoping to learn a bit from my mentee as well. I also like teaching.

### Co-ops

Full-Stack Development, Quality Assurance, Generative AI-UX Intersection

### Interests

I don't want anything formal -- that's not my style. I prefer close connections, and I'm very keen on sharing my advice. However, I wouldn't want to have scenarios solely around "getting lunch", we may prefer to do an activity together at some point. An activity that we may do together is go to museums, for example, or maybe a business conference nearby.

### What to Expect From Me

I am an individual who has a great passion for learning and experiencing new things. I take pride in sharing new things with other people, and I am enthusiastic about making the world a better place. I strive every day to become a better person, and I hope to pass these values on to the next generation of Drexel students.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Not formal. Friendly. Not one-sided. Simple.
