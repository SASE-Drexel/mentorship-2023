### About

I love listening to music (we can make a blend and plenty of playlists together on Spotify)!! People mainly associate me with Spotify or sleep LOL. I also enjoy playing and watching tennis, as well as watching dramas during non-academic times. I also love hunting for good food places!! 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

As a CS major, I'm still exploring my career options. I like office settings, and I'm using each co-op to test out different positions and different sized companies.

### Career Goals

I want to be a SASE mentor because I remember how scary it is to be an underclassmen (idk how I made it to my 3rd year). And it's so much more comforting to see a familiar face around and have someone to talk to/go to for advice. Also I had a super cool mentor who happens to be your president 

### Co-ops

Apex Silver

### Interests

I hope you trust me and that we become friends!! I can (possibly) help you with schoolwork if you need it (and I save old exams so I got you). We can always have deep convos about life too cause that's always fun in the middle of the night. Oh, and I got you covered on how to NOT end up in the ER if you ever live in Summit in your future LMAO. And I also got you covered on where to watch for dips/cracks in the sidewalk 

### What to Expect From Me

Unlike what by RBF gives off, I am actually super friendly night owl (just very easily intimidated by people). I'm pretty quiet and shy at first, but they keywords are definitely at first. Also unlike what people say, I do touch grass!! If you don't see me taking a nap somewhere (and anywhere) on campus, you'll probably find me listening to music or crying over the fact that my code is broken TT

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

We're about to be the greatest of friends. Let's hangout and grab food together!! If you need any advice, I got you :)
