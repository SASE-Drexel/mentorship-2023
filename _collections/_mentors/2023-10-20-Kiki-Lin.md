### About

For my mbti friends- ESFP. Friendly. Sociable. Goes out too much. Always tired. Never getting good sleep. Too busy. Likes to travel. Don't have money to travel. Pleasant company (I hope).

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

To meet new people c:

### Career Goals

Software engineer at a big company on a team with cool people- working on something I enjoy and making lots of money

### Co-ops

Lockheed Martin, eMoney Advisor, Vanguard

### Interests

I swear I lose more and more of my interests as I age. I go to work, come home or to club events. Currently playing volleyball if that counts for anything. I'm interested in being lazy and watching tiktoks. Travel, sports, food, music (rnb, kpop, pop, rap), hanging out with friends, late night talks. idk

### What to Expect From Me

Ambition can't wait!

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s)
