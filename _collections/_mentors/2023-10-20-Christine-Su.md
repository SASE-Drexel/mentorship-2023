### About

A mix of energetic/outgoing and couch potato. I don't really know how to describe myself so you'll find out when you meet me, lol 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I was a mentee in my Freshman year and met an amazing mentor. She was very supportive, kind, and fun. We stay connected throughout our years at Drexel and even after she graduated. I wish to give my future mentee support and company like how my mentor was to me.

### Career Goals

To be in a position working with data or be in a role related to project management

### Co-ops

Baltimore, Gas & Electric: New Business Support || PECO: Work Management Business Analyst (for details, check LinkedIn lol)

### Interests

Late night drives while blasting music, sleep, learning to mix drinks, learning to cook

### What to Expect From Me

Help out wherever I can and just be a listener if they wanna rant. Nothing too specific, just be there for them as buddies ü§ù

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Buddies roaming Drexel together and learning from each other
