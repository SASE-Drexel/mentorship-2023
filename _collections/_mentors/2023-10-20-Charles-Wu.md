### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

full time minecraft youtuber

### Career Goals

being a mentor for SASE is an opportunity to make a positive impact, both on the lives of aspiring Asian scientists and engineers and on your own personal and professional growth. It's a chance to give back, promote diversity and inclusion, and be a part of a supportive community of like-minded individuals.

### Co-ops

UPenn 

### Interests

We can be really professional and talk about career and ambitions or just get food occasionally or build something on my minecraft world or all of the options

### What to Expect From Me

Cause I'm just Ken, anywhere else I'd be a ten
Is it my destiny to live and die a life of blonde fragility?
I'm just Ken
Where I see love, she sees a friend
What will it take for her to see the man behind the tan and fight for me?
