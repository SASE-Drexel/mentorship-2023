### About

I’m a fairly introverted person, but I enjoy hanging out with friends, whether it be online or in person. While I can be quite busy at times, I always try to make time for others. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

College can be a really tough transition, even if you excelled in high school. I learned a lot from other people when I came to Drexel, and I want to pass that knowledge on so the transition to Drexel isn’t quite as hard as it was for me.

### Career Goals

My primary career goal is to pursue a career in aerospace, specifically in design, and hopefully work on the newest tech in the industry. In addition, I hope to work my way up into different leadership positions in projects and different organizations.

### Co-ops

Manufacturing Engineer @ Curtiss-Wright

### Interests

I’m big into anime and gaming, as well as flight simulation, model kits, Dungeons & Dragons, and volleyball. 

### What to Expect From Me

My mentorship would be fairly casual, with meetups whenever my mentee would like to talk about whatever, from professional development, to surviving classes.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I hope to keep a friendly relationship with my mentee, with both professional and casual meetups whenever for whatever reason.
