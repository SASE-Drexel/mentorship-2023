### About

Anime, drawing, singing, WWE (John Cena stuff), cooking & eating.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Be happy (be rich and watch anime)

### Career Goals

Just want to make good memories before I leave.

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

Fun. If it's not fun, there's no reason to do this. I'll probably join in many sase events with my mentee and hang out with them if I can. Also probably make them into a future sase eboard member if I can.

### What to Expect From Me

Talkative, bit of a troll when it's fun, joker (usually dark humor), loves math, very expressive.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Making a chant or a signature move by ourselves. And hopefully becoming the best friends in the process.
