### About

Talkative, bit of a troll when it's fun, joker (usually dark humor), loves math, very expressive.

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

Just want to make good memories before I leave.

### Career Goals

Be happy (be rich and watch anime)

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

Anime, drawing, singing, WWE (John Cena stuff), cooking & eating.

### What to Expect From Me

Fun. If it's not fun, there's no reason to do this. I'll probably join in many sase events with my mentee and hang out with them if I can. Also probably make them into a future sase eboard member if I can.

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Making a chant or a signature move by ourselves. And hopefully becoming the best friends in the process.
