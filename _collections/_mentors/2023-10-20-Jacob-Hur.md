### About

I love to climb. I currently work at The Cliffs at Callowhill, which is a climbing wall near China Town. If you think youâ€™ll be interested in climbing too, Iâ€™ll take you whenever for freeðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I would like to maybe find a job in the radiation therapy field. Helping others always made me happy so a career being able to help people in need sounds great to me.

### Career Goals

When I had just gotten into Uni, I received Angel as my mentor, which was a great experience for me since she was very nice and enthusiastic to help me whenever I needed it. Now that I am older, I wanted to maybe pass on that legacy and help out younger students as well. I would be open to just making a new friend as well! 

### Co-ops

Worked at a Chemical lab testing different drug samples

### Interests

Mentorship with me would probably just feel like having another friend. Iâ€™d like to get to know each other better and just have fun! Iâ€™m also open to help you out with anything so always feel free to ask. If youâ€™re an outdoor person, Iâ€™ll love to go on adventures together hehe. 

### What to Expect From Me

Hey guys, Iâ€™m Jacob. Iâ€™m a Chemical Engineering major thatâ€™s in the 5 year 3 Co-Op program in Drexel. I love sports and outdoor activities so if you like them too, weâ€™ll get along. I LOVE food. One of my life goals is to travel around the world to try out all sorts of different kinds of food. Letâ€™s go restaurant hunting togetherðŸ¤­

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Super chill. Iâ€™d probably like it if we just become great friends. I may joke around a lot so be ready to be bombarded with corny jokesðŸ˜€
