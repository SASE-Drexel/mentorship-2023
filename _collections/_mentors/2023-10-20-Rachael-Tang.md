### About

I personally enjoy sleeping and napping but if I had to be awake I would spend my time indulging in Harry Potter lore. I enjoy reading books, I like to play video games like LoL, Valorant, and Stardew Valley, etc, and I also part take in journaling/scrapbooking. 

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I really enjoy front-end development so I'd like to pursue that path for my future career. 

### Career Goals

When I think of a mentor, I think of a helpful and experienced friend who has been in my shoes before and is there to comfort me as I walk through the year. Seeing how much my mentors had helped me in the past, makes me want to help others whether it's academically or just being their friend.

### Co-ops

Comcast 

### Interests

I'd like to be friends with my mentee. I know being an underclassman at Drexel is hard and gaining friends can be difficult. So I want to be that person my mentee can come to with questions and advice if needed. There's no stress when it comes to being friends with me. 

### What to Expect From Me

Hi, I'm Rachael Tang. Iâ€™m an introvert and my MBTI is INFP. I'm obsessed with Harry Potter and I spend too much money on blind boxes. I like to collect random cute things to keep in my room. I listen to music basically 24/7 (Indie, RnB, K-Pop). I'm a commuter, but it doesn't mean I'll neglect you!
