### About

I'm 6'1

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I was just told to sign up and I don't know what I am signing up for. Having a mentee would be like having a sidekick and I think that's cool. I also really want to help mentees find their way around Drexel since it is really hard to navigate and because I was lost my first year. 

### Career Goals

I just want to find a co-op please Drexel please

### Co-ops

None

### Interests

I like playing games, hanging out with friends, exploring the city and new places, and eating good food.

### What to Expect From Me

I will not neglect them. I shall nurture them like a baby bird and making sure that they can fly on their own. I would also help them with whatever they need, whether it be school work or being there for them. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

I envision myself hanging out with them, talking to them, chilling them, and just being lifelong friends with them!
