### About

I think Iâ€™m friendly, I like talking about anything thatâ€™s cool (if youâ€™re passionate about it then Iâ€™ll gladly listen!), and Iâ€™m always down for a good time!

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

I want to be a SASE mentor to be able to pass along any information that would be useful to a someone coming into Drexel after me. I also want to make a new friend to bring to SASE events! 

### Career Goals

become a professional engineer and manager, maybe in hvac

### Co-ops

CHOP - Building Facilities

### Interests

going to asian org events ðŸ’€, music/concerts (kpop <3), dancing, traveling, going out for food/dessert, marvel movies

### What to Expect From Me

My mentee could come to me with advice whenever they need and Iâ€™d come to them with opportunities I think would be good for professional development if thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re looking for! My mentee can decide what kind of mentor they need me to be

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

just being there as a friend who can offer advice when needed and someone they know they can hang out with at and outside of events
