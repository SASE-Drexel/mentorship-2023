### About

My interests include plants, cats, valorant, sleeping, blogging/editing, fashion, etc

### Why Do I Want To Be a SASE Mentor?

My short term career goal is to work in various sectors of Finance such as FinTech, Global Trade and Quantitative Finance. 

### Career Goals

I've been in SASE since my freshmen year and now I'm a pre-junior so I want to meet some underclassmen who are involved in SASE. Many people in SASE are in STEM but SASE is for everyone. If anyone is having a hard time fitting in or wants some guidance, I'm down to help.

### Co-ops

Business Analyst 

### Interests

I shall protect them with my big muscles and brains 

### What to Expect From Me

I am a night owl who only feels productive doing work late at night. When I'm not taking a nap, I'm spending money on boba, shopping, and other outings. I'd say I'm a private person but I'm always down to make more friends. 

### How I Envision My Relationship With My Mentee(s) 

Friendly and casual
