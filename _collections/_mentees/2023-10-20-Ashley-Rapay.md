### About

I am a Filipino American who is very kind, caring, sporty, ambiverted, responsible, and likes meeting new people that I can find myself getting along with. I’m from New York and I came to Philly for college. I’m the oldest sibling and I feel like I learned a lot about being responsible and taking care of my younger sister. I love hanging out with friends and family and going outside to go on an adventure. 

### Career Goals

I like drawing, painting, crafting, writing, reading, photography, volleyball, lacrosse, sports in general, reading, writing, journaling, singing and playing instruments.  

### Interests

I’m unsure of my career goals, but as a product design major I think I want to go towards making products in the sports industry. Other than that, im not so sure yet but I do like crafting things. 

### Looking For

As a mentor, I would like someone who personally can help me if I have any questions academically or the real world, a very nice friendship where we would continue to talk to each other outside of SASE events frequently, and just someone cool :)
