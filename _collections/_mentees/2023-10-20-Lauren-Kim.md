### About

I'm a bit of a workaholic and pretty energetic. I love being out and about but also cherish a good chill day in as well. I used to be extremely introverted so during COVID I tried to become more outgoing, and according to my MBTI (ENFJ), I am :)

### Career Goals

I try my best to volunteer at least once a week, currently have been signing up for volunteering opportunities from the asian orgs but I typically enjoy walking dogs for Saved Me. I also love love love food and am big on spending time with people even if its just to go grocery shopping. 

### Interests

I plan to go to medical school and work with children either as a pediatrician or pediatric psychiatrist and encourage more holistic solutions. 

### Looking For

Just someone to spend some time with especially if it involves food. Some help in physics would also be amazing but not necessary :)
