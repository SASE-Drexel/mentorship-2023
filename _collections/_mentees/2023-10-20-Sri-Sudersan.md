### About

I am a masters in Computer Science student. I did my undergrad in Electronics but I realized that I want to do something more practical in life and transitioned to CS and ever since, I havent looked back and as I started to learn more, I realized solving problems with other people and collaborating makes everything so much better. I am an adventurous person and I am always down to meet new people and learn from their experiences and life.

### Career Goals

Developing Websites, Solving Problems, Cooking, Road Trips and Travel.

### Interests

After I graduate, I aim to work in NYC in a technical cum Managerial position as I pass my wisdom to early career professionals, for about 4 years and then I hope to become a Digital Nomad, essentially traveling around the world, coding, meeting clients and just experience life.

### Looking For

I'd love to network with people all around the world and get to know more about their experiences and maybe also develop an application or start a project together.
