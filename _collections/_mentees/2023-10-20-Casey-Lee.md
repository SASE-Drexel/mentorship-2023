### About

I am from Central New Jersey, and am Taiwanese and Cantonese. I love to stay active, workout, and am a super big runner, I ran track from 5th-12th grade. I love all foods, specifically taiwanese beef noodle soup, and pretty much anything that involves carbs. I'd like to say I am pretty adventurous, spontaneous, and optimistic. I also love all music like indie and house.

### Career Goals

I am interested in art and design. I love fashion, clothing, keeping up with the trends. I mentioned before I like to stay active, working out and running. 

### Interests

I'd like to become either a UX designer, UI designer, or Product Design. I think it would be cool if one day I could be a creative director at some point. 

### Looking For

I'd like to have a mentor that would help with all things personal like an older sibling while also being able to help me through the academics and the co-op system. I'd like a resource that I can ask anything with no judgement.
