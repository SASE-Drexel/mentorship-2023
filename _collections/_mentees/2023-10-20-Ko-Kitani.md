### About

Hi! I’m Ko, and I’m a first-year civil engineer. I come from California, I like watching sports (especially football and basketball), hanging out with friends, and trying new things. 

### Career Goals

I’m not 100% sure what I want to do in terms of my career, I think an interest for now is pursuing a career as a structural engineer. 

### Interests

Some of my interests include hiking, exploring new places, eating food, listening to music, playing or watching sports, and traveling.

### Looking For

I mainly want a mentor to help show me the ropes of Drexel, both academically and socially. I’m interested in learning more about the co-op process, resume building, interviews, and everything in between. Finding a balance between the two is something I think a mentor can help me with. Also since I’m not from around here a few Philly recommendations wouldn’t hurt!
