### About

I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City my entire life. Some of my hobbies include enjoy exploring the city and trying out new stuff. I'm a bit of an introvert so sometimes it's hard for me to open up to people. But I like to give it my all in almost everything I do.

### Career Goals

I'm mainly interested in website design, but I'm also a bit interested in software development and want to try out that side. But outside of my major, I'm also interested in graphic design, social media/marketing, and the psychology of both and how it affects everyday life. 

### Interests

As a small goal, I'd like to expand my skill set by getting comfortable with different types of design softwares and coding languages, such as Figma, Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop, and Javascript. I aim to get a good internship this year (and for my co-ops) and gain as much experience to build up my resume and portfolio before I graduate and hopefully become pretty knowledgeable on UX/UI design by then. 

### Looking For

I'm looking for a mentor thatâ€™s preferably in the same major as me, and a third-year or higher as I'd like to get to know their experiences with co-op. I'd like someone that is easy to talk to, pretty responsive and both personable and professional when needed. I would like them to be open to giving feedback on projects or a portfolio and know how to give constructive criticism/advice.
