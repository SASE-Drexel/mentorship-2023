### About

i am an ece student who is full of love and appreciation for the small things in life 

### Career Goals

to work a job that i am genuinely interested in because if i'm a cog in the machine at least let me do it happily. that and make a lot of money. i likely would want to work in software on a team towards a shared project that can produce a palpable result 

### Interests

instruments (piano, bass), food, movies, exploring new places, exercising (gym, muai thay), cooking, sitting around plainly while basking in contentment

### Looking For

ultimately i am looking for someone who i can rely on, both professionally and personally. somebody who i can casually ask to hang out with and/or help me with anything academically, but in a mutually beneficial relationship in which they genuinely enjoy my company.
