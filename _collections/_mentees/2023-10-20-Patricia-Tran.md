### About

I am a computer science major, and I hope to make the most out of my college career. I am also a member of VSA, ASA, and Women in Computing Society. I try to be an organized person and plan out my school days. I like to talk to new people, and while I am always excited to make new friends, I also like spending time in my dorm ever since my roommate and I bought a sunset light.

### Career Goals

I like hanging out with friends and trying out new restaurants or cafes. I also like to go thrifting and exploring local shops. I like to go hiking during the summer, and I got into pickleball last year and ran into my physics teacher at a pickleball court.

### Interests

So far, I hope to work as a front-end developer or website developer in the future. I am looking forward to my co-ops and using those to learn what I like to do. I hope that I can both work in a team and be a leader in my career.

### Looking For

I am looking for a friendly mentor! I would love to talk to my mentor about tea and new tea places. I am looking for a mentor who is passionate about their major and someone who balances both academics and life outside of school.
