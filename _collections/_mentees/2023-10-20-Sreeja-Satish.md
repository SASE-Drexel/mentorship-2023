about: Hey, I'm Sreeja! I'm from Bergen County, New Jersey. I'm pretty chill as a person, and I love hanging out with friends for simple things like studying or exciting things like going to explore new places. I really like finding out new things to do, indoors and outdoors included. However I'm pretty indecisive, so don't expect me to make decisions on the spot. Most of my favorite things consist of being cozy at home, since I'm pretty introverted. But with the right people, I can be really playful! I love photography and capturing memories, being in nature (watching sunsets and stargazing >>>), cafes, and spending time with people I care about! You can be one too <3 
year: Sophomore

### About

Hey, I'm Sreeja! I'm from Bergen County, New Jersey. I'm pretty chill as a person, and I love hanging out with friends for simple things like studying or exciting things like going to explore new places. I really like finding out new things to do, indoors and outdoors included. However I'm pretty indecisive, so don't expect me to make decisions on the spot. Most of my favorite things consist of being cozy at home, since I'm pretty introverted. But with the right people, I can be really playful!

I love photography and capturing memories, being in nature (watching sunsets and stargazing >>>), cafes, and spending time with people I care about! You can be one too <3 


### Career Goals

- photography!
- music (varied taste as long as I vibe with it, but mainly the genres of kpop, pop and bollywood/indian!)
- watching shows 
- pets <33
- playing volleyball
- taking day trips and exploring the city!
- reading!

### Interests

I switched over to UXID recently, and I'm excited to learn more skills and branch out! I want to be able to learn more about what I like so that I can get better at what I do! I want to do something I care about, so it can help me live comfortably and provide for the people I care about!

### Looking For

I want to someone I can really vibe with, and just be besties with. I want to have a mentor that can help me grow and improve myself, and also look out for me! Overall, someone friendly who also loves to explore and do things, and maybe is also in UXID?!
