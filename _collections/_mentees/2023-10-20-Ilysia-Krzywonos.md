### About

Hello! My name is Ilysia, I am a freshman at Drexel. I am mainly introverted but I enjoy meeting new people and hearing about their experiences. I enjoy challenging myself and placing myself in situations that may make me uncomfortable but will help me grow. 

### Career Goals

In my free time I watch a wide array of dramas or bad reality TV. I also like playing musical instruments, gaming, rock climbing, badminton, volunteering, cooking, trying new foods, and photography. 

### Interests

I want to discover what concentration/field  I enjoy the most in computer science. I’d like to work in a lot of different positions in the future and gain experience working on varying projects to find the best fit for myself. 

### Looking For

I think a mentor would be really beneficial for me because I have a lot of uncertainty and questions surrounding my future academic plans and professional development in my field. Hearing another’s experiences can provide me with some insight and guidance to navigate my own plans. I also want to use this opportunity to meet new people that I hopefully can bond with and create meaningful connections.
