### About

I’m from the Poconos, PA but I was born in Brooklyn. I’m more on the quiet side in a big group setting but I like meeting new people. I do best in smaller groups or one-on-one. When I am interested in something, I tend to commit fully to it. 

### Career Goals

I want to create something that will be able to help a lot of people in the world. Or I would like to create something that helps the environment.

### Interests

I like collecting knickknacks and making them. I also like taking care of fish and aquatic plants. I mostly like listening to k-rnb and k-pop. I like trying out new things.

### Looking For

I want a mentor that could be like an older sibling for me. Also, if they were a westphal student I could get inspiration from them. I am mostly looking for a personal mentor though that could also help guide me in the right direction if I ever need academic or professional help.
