### About

My name is Matthew I am originally from South Carolina I moved here mainly cause I've always wanted to live in a city. But also there are just a lot more opportunities here than if I had gone to a college in the state. I would say one good thing about me is I know when to shut up im ngl I don't know how to elaborate on that. Also, one bad thing about me is I have horrible grammar. Like to the point where I'll put long text messages in Grammarly just in case.

### Career Goals

Not exactly sure but the reason I choose business is the problem-solving aspect. I think ideally I would like to be a consultant and choose something like information technology or data.

### Interests

I like to cook I got good at it cause I kind of got tired of my parents cooking. So I learned how to make food for myself. I used to play video games but I didn't bring my PC with me cause I'm tryna be studious now.

### Looking For

Nothing in particular I'm just tryna meet more people and I think this would be a great way to do that. I guess someone thats like old and wise and knows useful resources or cool places to go.
