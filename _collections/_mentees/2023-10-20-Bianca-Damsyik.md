about: As an Indonesian-American, I often find it difficult to fit into certain groups. From growing up in a predominantly white neighborhood to attending a predominantly white school, I became used to code switching my personality. In 10th grade, I finally found people who allowed me to open up and be my true, authentic self- talking a lot (according to my best friend), getting boba at least once a week, and thriving most when I have a million things to do rather than nothing at all. I am hoping to double major or possibly minor in bio!

### About

As an Indonesian-American, I often find it difficult to fit into certain groups. From growing up in a predominantly white neighborhood to attending a predominantly white school, I became used to code switching my personality. In 10th grade, I finally found people who allowed me to open up and be my true, authentic self- talking a lot (according to my best friend), getting boba at least once a week, and thriving most when I have a million things to do rather than nothing at all. I am hoping to double major or possibly minor in bio!

### Career Goals

Career goal wise, I aim to have a job that’ll allow me to retire my parents. I have seen them struggle and I want to change that for them after I graduate from Drexel. I am most interested in banking or hopefully working for a company like Google or Chrome.

### Interests

My interests include binging marvel movies, spending 9+ hours on homework, and hanging out with my cat. I’ve done ballet since I was six and hope to continue that while at Drexel. I also love to scrapbook whenever I have the chance.

### Looking For

If I had a mentor, I’d want someone who I can vent to and reach out for help whenever needed. Because I overthink everything, I’d want my mentor to help me make good decisions and basically act as a big sister/brother. I’d also want someone who has the same interests as me (cats, boba, ballet, etc). I have yet to meet someone at Drexel who hasn’t been kind or helpful, so I know that having a mentor will help me get more involved and allow me to open up more! :)
