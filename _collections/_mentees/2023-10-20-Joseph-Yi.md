about: Hi, I am Joseph Yi, I'm a computer engineering major and I like playing games and listening to R&B music. I also like playing music and have been trying to get back into playing the viola since I used to play the viola for 8 years but haven't played in a while. One thing that I really like to do is try out different cuisines. Whenever I'm given the opportunity I like to try different foods from different places. This is also the reason I like cooking but I haven't been able to do much of that recently.

### About

Hi, I am Joseph Yi, I'm a computer engineering major and I like playing games and listening to R&B music. I also like playing music and have been trying to get back into playing the viola since I used to play the viola for 8 years but haven't played in a while. One thing that I really like to do is try out different cuisines. Whenever I'm given the opportunity I like to try different foods from different places. This is also the reason I like cooking but I haven't been able to do much of that recently.

### Career Goals

I don't really have a dream job or anything specifically but I do want to work at a computer hardware and computer software centered co op to learn which one I like better. 

### Interests

I like working with computer hardware, software, and programming which is why I chose computer engineering. Also stuff related to things like 3D printing and AI development I think are pretty cool.

### Looking For

I am looking for a professional and academic mentor that can advise and help me thorough my academic studies and with any academic question that I have. It would be nice to learn from an upperclassmen on the best ways to stay on top of school work and the best ways to apply myself at Drexel.
