### About

i’m an ex exploratory psychology student, but they kicked me out and put me in a different psych (ward). now i’m a struggling uxid kid who wastes all of my money on retail therapy and cute drinks to feed my delusions. i am aggressively shaking my tin can and will accept all donations. i love reading and writing; learning about the ocean, typology, and languages; hanging out with the neighborhood cats; and just having a good laugh, honestly. let’s have fun together! message approved by sreeja and michelle, hehe 

### Career Goals

i’d like to become a UX designer and work from home. while i don’t know the specifics, my goal is to live both a comfortable and lavish (not too lavish) lifestyle! i want to be the rich and mysterious auntie with good stories to tell 

### Interests

i love the ocean and sharks. i think sharks are so cute, especially lemons and makos. i’m an art kid at heart.. although i can’t draw.. my form of art is writing and just creating stuff in general! also a very avid kpop and drama fan. i think psychoanalyzing and picking apart characters, songs, and movies are fun too. 

### Looking For

i’d like my mentor to share my values and my passions. i think communication is key, so if they can speak to me with the same level of drive and passion, i’d appreciate it a lot. i hope my mentor can be someone i can learn a lot from and also someone i can share my laughter with.
