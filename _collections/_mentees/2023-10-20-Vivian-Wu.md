### About

I would describe myself as an introverted extrovert. I am energetic, adventurous, and loyal. I am also a very adaptable person as I have had many large changes in my life including living internationally. 

### Career Goals

Currently, I hoping to define my career goals more as I continue to explore academically in my major. Generally, I hope to be in a stable but creative position. I hope to have opportunities to make change and interact with a community. 

### Interests

I love art, reading, and exploring. I love traveling and have been to many different countries. I love learning about culture, trying new things, and just pushing myself to take more risks. 

### Looking For

My friend encouraged me to push myself out of my comfort zone and meet new people in different clubs and social groups. I hope to gain a mentor that will help continue to challenge me and hold me accountable. I am looking for someone to help me network as well as just have good personal advice and guidance.
