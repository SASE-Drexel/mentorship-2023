### About

Hi, I'm Ben and currently a freshman. I'm a little introverted, but I am friendly and open up a lot when people get to know me. I also love food and love going out to eat with people. My favorite food is sushi!

### Career Goals

I want to work in the quantitative trading field or as a software engineer. I’m also interested in working on machine learning and AI. However, I don’t have much experience in any of these fields, so I want to try to find coops to see if I like them. 

### Interests

Academically, I am interested in computer science and math, and I am thinking about double majoring in them. Outside of academics I like to play videogames. I also like watching shows but mostly anime. My favorite genre of music is Kpop, and my favorite group is BLACKPINK. 

### Looking For

I am looking for someone who I can ask for help with topics related to school whether it be specific to my major, events and clubs at Drexel, or even about coops. But I am also looking for someone in CCI who I can get to know who isn’t in the same year as me. I want to get to know more people who aren’t just in the same year as me.
