about: Hi, My name is Matthew and I'm from northeast Philly! I'm a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering with a strong aspiration to specialize in aerospace, particularly in defense or exploration applications. I enjoy a wide variety of different games, sports, and other activities. I've recently taken up Muay Thai as a new interest and am slowly improving. My favorite food is either sushi or hotpot and I really like naps. I've also got this pretty big collection of penguins going on.

### About

Hi, My name is Matthew and I'm from northeast Philly! I'm a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering with a strong aspiration to specialize in aerospace, particularly in defense or exploration applications. I enjoy a wide variety of different games, sports, and other activities. I've recently taken up Muay Thai as a new interest and am slowly improving. My favorite food is either sushi or hotpot and I really like naps. I've also got this pretty big collection of penguins going on.
