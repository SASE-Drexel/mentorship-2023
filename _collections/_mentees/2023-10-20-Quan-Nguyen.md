### About

I'm an understanding, reliable, and light hearted person. I am very honest about my opinions but sometimes I come across as blunt. I'm introverted but love spending quality time with people I feel comfortable around. I'm a hard worker and try to get things done as soon as possible, however, I can become easily distracted. I love learning new things like random little facts to cultural traditions, and I just like to be educated in the world around us. 

### Career Goals

I like walking, biking, running, casual reading, eating, and listening to music. I listen to a lot of R&B, but also listen to a lot of other types of music, usually upbeat music. I also like fashion and shoes, especially Asics. I like going to museums (I love the Mutter museum) and enjoy movies. 

### Interests

I'm honestly open to anything in the chemistry field, however, I would love to research ingredients and formulate skincare or perfume products. I guess it would be a dream to create cosmetic products for a smaller business while also having some form of leadership position in the brand too. 

### Looking For

I'm looking for a very supportive person who is open minded and understanding. I have difficulty expressing myself so having a mentor who is more talkative would be helpful. I'd like it if my mentor has done 2 co-ops, so I can learn more about the process and the experiences they've had. I have no specific preference on my mentor's major, but I wouldn't want a mentor going to medical school since I am not.
