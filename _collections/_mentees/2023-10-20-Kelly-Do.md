### About

Hii. I love meeting new people and connecting with them beyond the surface level. I'm a big  listener and enjoy hanging out with others and learning more about them. I like to critque movie endings and unwillingly nap anywhere that's quiet enough. I'm excited to meet new people and grow in all aspects.

### Career Goals

I like to watch movies, play games like Roblox and Valorant, eat yummy food and read (i need book suggestions ;-;). I also enjoy just hanging out with people and walking around in nice weather.

### Interests

I want to have a stable and enjoyable job that makes a lot of money. Hopefully, I get to be in an environment where I can collaborate with others and still have free time.

### Looking For

I want to be good friends with my mentor and also be able to ask them about life, college, and just everything in general.
