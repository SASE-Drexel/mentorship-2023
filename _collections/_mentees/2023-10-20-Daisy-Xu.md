### About

I am a very introverted person who would love to learn more programming knowledge.  I like listening to music and scrolling on social media during my free time. I consider myself to be a curious and studious student. I love to spread awareness on social justice issues and I hope to use my programming skills to raise awareness in the future. 


### Career Goals

Outside of school, my interests are gardening, baking, and going on my phone. I also like traveling, finding new restaurants, and discovering events. 

### Interests

In the future, I hope to work as a game developer or a software engineer.


### Looking For

As a mentee, I hope I can learn more interpersonal and professional skills from my mentor.  I hope that I can improve my career-developing skills such as co-op, resume building, and networking.  I also hope that I can get to meet more people and form friendships through this mentorship program.
