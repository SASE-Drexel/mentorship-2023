about: I'm small but powerful, like the energizer bunny! I'd like to think I'm pretty assertive and know what I want. But I'm also pretty laid back and like to go with the flow. My outlook on life is optimistic pessimism, so hope for the best and plan for the worst. I've been told that I have a pretty big voice, which I don't see as a bad thing. My ADHD can sometimes get the best of me, but I think that's what makes my life exciting. And I live for dad jokes.

### About

I'm small but powerful, like the energizer bunny! I'd like to think I'm pretty assertive and know what I want. But I'm also pretty laid back and like to go with the flow. My outlook on life is optimistic pessimism, so hope for the best and plan for the worst. I've been told that I have a pretty big voice, which I don't see as a bad thing. My ADHD can sometimes get the best of me, but I think that's what makes my life exciting. And I live for dad jokes. 

### Career Goals

Ultimately, I wanna do something I love. Money is a driving factor, but I'd be okay with a smaller pay if it means I can wake up every morning excited to go to work. But I don't really know what I love yet, so I have no plan for my career path. 

### Interests

music, singing, dancing, food(like all food), kpop, kdramas, webtoons, the color red, dad jokes, MCU

### Looking For

Someone who I can come to about academic and personal things. Who can tell me "do this" or "that won't be good" while keeping my best interest at heart. I would hope my mentor can tell me things straight with no BS, especially if it looks like I'm losing my way. I would also like someone who can understand my struggles with having ADHD.
