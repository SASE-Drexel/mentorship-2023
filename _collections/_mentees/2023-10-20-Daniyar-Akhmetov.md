### About

Hello, my name is Daniyar and I am from Kazakhstan (Central Asia). I am very versatile person, my hobbies are basketball, soccer or any kind of sports:)
I am very glad to be part of SASE and aiming for expansion of my both academic and social skills through this organization. I prefer mixture of study and relaxation.

### Career Goals

To work in a field I am passionate about
Work for the top company
Establish myself as a professional in the U.S. market

### Interests

As I said before sports are an irreplaceable part of my life
I like anime, but not a guru ( fav anime - Death Note)
I like Computer Science from perspective that a lot of stuff needs to be not just learned but understood, like the process of delving in this area ( but at the same time a little bit scared of major difficulty)

### Looking For

I want a mentor who at first would be my friend, whom I would have an opportunity to ask questions, learn something and improve as person.
I want a mentor who would sincerely try to help me in all spheres
