### About

Hi!!! My name is Michael and I'm a second year biology major. I like to play video games and I LOVE to eat ramen and cheesesteak. I am passionate when it comes to learning about new science topics (not including ecology). I want to learn to connect with other people and build relationships with them and that's why I am doing this mentorship sign-up. 

### Career Goals

I like to walk around the city and explore places, new restaurants, and be around my friends. I listen to all kinds of music genres and am willing to accept music recommendations! I also like to be challenged with doing new things because I kind of get bored easily.

### Interests

Iâ€™m currently on the pre-med track preparing for med school. My plan is to become a physician so I can make a positive impact on other people. I hope to grow personally from meeting new people and collaborate with those in the medical field to continue learning about the newest advancements in medicine.

### Looking For

I am looking for a mentor who is willing to be my friend and someone to help guide me to make the most out of my time here at drexel. Someone that is desirable would be able to help me grow personally, help me to become a good leader and work well with people. It would be a bonus if they are someone that goes outside to go to places and does things because I need to go outside more and not just come to campus for class or clubs.
