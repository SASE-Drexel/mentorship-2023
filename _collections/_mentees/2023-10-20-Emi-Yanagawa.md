### About

Hi I’m Emi. I’m from Bay Area, California, (yes i love my avocados) I’m Japanese. I’m the marketing director for Drexel’s health administration services, public relations chair for Drexel student nurses association, lead graphic designer for Upenn Hawthorn Magazine. I have a Bengal cat named May back home and I love exploring global cuisines! I love trying out new restaurants/ cafe, cooking with friends, and being out in the sun! 

### Career Goals

It’s highly likely that my career goals will change throughout college but as of now I’m looking to become a nurse practitioner specializing in oncology or something surgical related. 

### Interests

I love love love cats! I enjoy meeting new people and being exposed to different cultures. I like going to the gym 2-3 times a week to stay active. Right now I’m interested in getting into fencing! 

### Looking For

I’m looking for a mentor who is academically high achieving and in the same major. Someone who can give me good advice through their own experience and has a lot of connections with students in or outside of Drexel! I’d definitely like to be friends with my mentor!!
