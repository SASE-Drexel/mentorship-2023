### About

I'm Ana and I'm currently studying UX Design. I would consider myself to be an omnivert. I love talking to people, but I tend to be more introverted in a professional/ school setting. I live in Garnet Valley, which is 40 minutes out of the city. I love shopping, eating out, and watching shows and movies. I also like to do design challanges in my free time. 

### Career Goals

One of my biggest goals right now is to expand my resume and portfolio. I also want to gain more experience is UX before I go into my Co-Ops. In the future I hope to be a part of some design team for a tech company to improve systems, UI design, or even product design for a better user experience. 

### Interests

Outside of school, I enjoy a lot of different artistic mediums such as design through media, painting with acrylics, and charcoal art. I've also been running long distance for 7 years now, and I enjoy training for long runs. Academically, I enjoy English and writing as a little side hobby. These passions fuel my creativity and keep me motivated.

### Looking For

In a mentor, I think I want someone that can guide me and give me advice on school and how I should approach my future professional ventures. They don't have to be in my major whatsoever, I am just looking for someone that can give me guidance and overall just have someone more experienced to talk to. I would love to become friends with them!
