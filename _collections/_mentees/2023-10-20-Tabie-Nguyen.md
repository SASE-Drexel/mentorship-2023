about: I would say I am someone who is dedicated and earnest once I commit myself to something. Academically and professionally, I consider myself to be goal-oriented, pragmatic, and always seeking opportunities to improve. With my friends and loved ones, I try my best to be there for them and support them, whether it be by offering a listening ear, giving advice, or just simply being in their company.

### About

I would say I am someone who is dedicated and earnest once I commit myself to something. Academically and professionally, I consider myself to be goal-oriented, pragmatic, and always seeking opportunities to improve. With my friends and loved ones, I try my best to be there for them and support them, whether it be by offering a listening ear, giving advice, or just simply being in their company. Having grown up in Vietnam for 16 years and then coming here, I have been able to really learn and unlearn myself, which encourages me to actively put myself out there and try new experiences! 

### Career Goals

I am a nursing major with the goal of becoming either a Nurse Practitioner or a CRNA (Nurse Anesthetist). I never knew how much I enjoyed being in healthcare until I started Anatomy 101; it kind of solidified my career choice for me. I also plan to do travel-nursing before going to grad school. 

### Interests

I enjoy reading, mostly fiction but I love classics as well. I listen to either R&B, rap, or indie music; it really just depends on the weather. And in my free time, I play pool (billiards) a lot but I’m actually getting worse at it so maybe I need to find a new hobby. 

### Looking For

I am looking to build a strong and solid “I got your back” rapport with my mentor. Other than looking up to them for career and professional advice like resume-building or co-op tips, I also would love to be able to confide in them, to hang out, to thrift and grab boba together, and to really form a meaningful friendship with them!
