### About

Hihiiii! My name is Jenny! I'm an ENFJ, so I really enjoy going on spontaneous trips just around philly, and trying new things! During my free time, I love to play volleyball & spend quality w my friends, and trying new foodsss hehe. I have a pretty bubbly personality, and a pretty hardworker, and half the time, I'll be studying sksk, but but I'll always be down to go on silly adventures w mi mentor <3

### Career Goals

#NAME?

### Interests

I aspire to become a registered nurse after graduation! (currently unsure what specialty, but hopefully through clinicals I can see my interests)!

### Looking For

I hope to have mentor who is kind, hardworking, and aspires to be someone I look up to. Someone who would support for things that I do whether socially or academically viceversa. Preferably someone whose personality is also extrovertedly introverted?! , and vibes w mi personality:)))) pstttt- do not need to be a nursing major :D
