### About

Hi! I’m a freshman majoring in Computer Science. I am also an international student from Indonesia, so I am still adapting to my new environment.

### Career Goals

I would love to build my resume first because currently, I have no experience related to my field. I am looking for many club events and activities I could do to develop my experience and gain more exposure. I would also like to be involved in more projects that would fit my portfolio. I have been looking for internships catered to first-year and second-year students and I am hoping to have my resume ready before applications start rolling. I think having experience early on would ease my way into landing a preferred job later on after graduation.

### Interests

I haven’t had many opportunities to travel abroad, so I’m interested in taking a Study Abroad program to either Seoul, Taiwan or Singapore.

### Looking For

I am not too sure what concentration or minor to take I will be taking but I have been leaning towards Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. I hope this mentorship program can help me find my interest and guide me academically, i.e., how to decide what classes to take for next term and how to choose a concentration and minor later. I am also hoping to hear more about my mentor’s professional experience and ask for advice on where to start. Coming from another country, I don’t know many people here, so hopefully I could make more connections and friends through this program.
