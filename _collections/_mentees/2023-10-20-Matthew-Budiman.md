### About

I'm an introvert who's striving to embrace extroverted qualities. My determination is fueled by my goal-oriented nature, always pushing me to excel. Friendship holds immense value for me, as past experiences have shown the unwavering support of friends in times of need. I love the joy of laughter and quality time spent with close friends, providing a welcome escape from the rigors of studying and stress. I cherish the bonds I share with friends immensely. 

### Career Goals

My interests span the art of photography, a journey that transformed my passion into a thriving business. Additionally, I've nurtured a lifelong love for K-pop and anime. 

### Interests

While I'm uncertain about my specific career path in biology, my goal is to give back to my mother for her countless sacrifices. Her selflessness motivates me to succeed in my chosen field, even though she may not expect anything in return. It's my way of showing gratitude.

### Looking For

I'm seeking a mentor who can be more than just a guide but also a friend. In the challenging world of STEM, having someone to confide in, exchange ideas with, and seek advice from is invaluable. I value a mentor who is approachable and willing to share their wisdom, helping me navigate the complexities of my chosen field and offering not just professional guidance but also a personal connection.
