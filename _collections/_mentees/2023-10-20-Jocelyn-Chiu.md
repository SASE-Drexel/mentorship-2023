### About

i like frogs :) I wouldn't say i'm particularly shy or extraverted, but I do prefer to be around people with the same interests and backgrounds because I'm kinda awkward when not. I do vibe with most people tho and I like meeting new people! 

### Career Goals

I work at a nonprofit called Coded By Kids as a UI/UX design lead, but I do want to grow more in terms of my UI/UX specific skillsets, which includes frontend, design, and a bit of psych. I'm thinking about going for corporate co-ops for stability but I also want to dabble in game design.

### Interests

I play nerdy video games when I have time! NOT Valorant but moreso singleplayer story-driven stuff like Bioshock, Deus Ex, Skyrim, etc. On a different note, I do some digital art, and I also used to play violin a lot!

### Looking For

I'm not really looking for a tryhard in terms of professionalism and career-centric focus, but I do want someone who takes it seriously so I have guidance for stuff like co-op. I don't really want it to be a strictly professional-oriented experience, and preferably someone who's more involved in the Drexel community cause I don't touch grass enough to be that person lmao. Otherwise I'd strongly prefer to bond with someone with similar interests like video games!
