about: I am an International Student from Vietnam, currently studying at Drexel. I am a CS major as well as a freshman. I had an older brother who also went to Drexel, and studied the same major. My reason for going to Drexel was for the Co-Op programme. I consider myself to be laid-back but am willing to put in the work when needed. I try to find the easiest way to do things rather than following by the rules.

### About

I am an International Student from Vietnam, currently studying at Drexel. I am a CS major as well as a freshman. I had an older brother who also went to Drexel, and studied the same major. My reason for going to Drexel was for the Co-Op programme. I consider myself to be laid-back but am willing to put in the work when needed. I try to find the easiest way to do things rather than following by the rules. 

### Career Goals

I want to graduate knowing a lot of skills related to the CS field, preferably software engineering. I also want to know many people who can help me forward my career.

### Interests

I like thrifting clothes, jewellery, fragrances. I also like to watch movies, tv shows, anime, etc. I also occasionally play video games.

### Looking For

I am looking for a mentor who is able to help me further my career options and goals. I want someone who is able to communicate well and is willing to explain things when I donâ€™t understand them. The mentor should have experience either in co-op or academics which I will then try to learn from.
