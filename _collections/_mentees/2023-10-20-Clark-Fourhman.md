### About

I'm fairly relaxed and passionate about all sorts of creative expressions and endeavors. I enjoy learning and tinkering. I love all sorts of different media such as cartoons, movies and comics. I'd like to think of myself as easy to get along with and enjoy helping people get into things that I enjoy. 



### Career Goals

My interests are in computer software and hardware and storytelling with digital art.

### Interests

At least as far as co-op I would really like to join a startup and a tech giant to really scope out things for my future. As of now I would like to end up in a software-based job though I feel like this could change. 

### Looking For

I'm looking for a friend and somebody to look up to that can guide me through my first year.
