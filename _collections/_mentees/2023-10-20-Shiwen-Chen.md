### About

I was born in China but moved to the US when I was 3. I'm normally quiet and reserved if I'm not that close with people but open up more when I get to know people. I'm also an introvert so socializing too much makes me tired. 

### Career Goals

Right now I'm not sure what careers I want to go into, but I'm thinking of accounting or business analyst. Hopefully, I get to explore all my options through co-op. 

### Interests

I started cooking in 6th grade and developed an interest in it. I also like to bake different kinds of pastries and cakes üç∞ I also started gardening a couple of years back. Some of the things I grow includes tomato, greens, peppers, and squash. 

### Looking For

I don't really have anything in specific finding a mentor. The most important thing is if we vibe or not üòö But it would be nice to have a mentor who can guide me through my co-ops and classes.
