about: I usually don't talk a lot, so when I do, you know it's because I see you as a close friend and someone I can trust. I am a very picky and indecisive person to be around (if you ask for a place to eat, don't ask me). I don't have a lot of patience, but when I do, I wait forever. I love food. If you give me food, we can instantly be friends.

### About

I usually don't talk a lot, so when I do, you know it's because I see you as a close friend and someone I can trust. I am a very picky and indecisive person to be around (if you ask for a place to eat, don't ask me). I don't have a lot of patience, but when I do, I wait forever. I love food. If you give me food, we can instantly be friends. 

### Career Goals

I hope to pursue a career as a nurse anesthetist or nurse practitioner. Both very rewarding fields with amazing salaries. Although I am not interested in travel nursing, I do hope to one day travel all over the world for my own pleasure as well as experience what the healthcare system is like outside the U.S. 

### Interests

I love to cook because it tastes better when you make it yourself. Tennis and Badminton are the only valid sports out there. If I had the money, I would travel and go on road trips with friends and family everyday. I also have an addition to Lego that people say I have a problem with.

### Looking For

I want a mentor that could share the same humor as me. I also want a mentor that helps promotes/encourages good things from me. I want to know what's best for me, how to succeed, and the tips/hacks in life. Also, I want a mentor that has a never-ending list of where to eat food.
