### About

My name is Keith Cho I am currently an MIS major looking to switch to data science or cybersecurity because I feel like I am not being challenged enough at Lebow. A lot of the classes seem like common knowledge, and I kinda want to learn more valueable skills like coding sql etc. Not stem major yet, but joining sase hoping to learn more ab switching

### Career Goals

Idk yet ngl co op gonna carry me

### Interests

Sports used to be everything to me, but as I get older and my body wears down I’m hoping to transition into some less physically taxing hobbies like piano art and photography that will stick with me for the rest of my life

### Looking For

I’m looking for someone that can be a friend, who I feel comfortable talking to and reaching out to without feeling like I am just formally asking for help.
