### About

Filipino American student studying mechanical engineering. I’m looking to take full advantage of the organizations at drexel and co-ops to get experience but also enjoy myself during my time in college and make friends. 

### Career Goals

I’m interested in aerospace and robotics. I’ve joined Drexel Lunabotics, Formula SAE, and SAE EV. Besides academics, I like playing tennis and volleyball. I have a collection of succulents and cacti. I listen to rock music. 

### Interests

Hopefully initially end up at a decent paying job in a city somewhere. Work in the private engineering sector for a bit and eventually end up at NASA for a fulfilling job and fat government benefits. 

### Looking For

A little bit of guidance as I try to figure out how to tackle my major, bs/ms, concentration and professional career but of course a friend would be nice too.
